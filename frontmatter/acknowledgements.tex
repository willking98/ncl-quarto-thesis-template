I’d like to take a moment to acknowledge all the brilliant minds who helped me get this thesis over the line, because, let’s face it, this wasn’t a one-man job – it was a circus, and I was the ringleader. First off, a massive thank you to my supervisor, who managed to look like they were listening during all those hours of me ranting about my research, when, in reality, they were probably just thinking about what to have for lunch. You’ve been invaluable... in some abstract, entirely theoretical way.

To my family, who have put up with my rants, my existential crises, and the fact that I’ve been more present in my academic writing than in any family photo album for the past three years – you’ve endured with grace. Frankly, I’ve been too busy to remember your names, but rest assured, your support has been... well, let’s say, "not unnoticed."

I’d also like to extend my deepest gratitude to the countless cups of coffee and packets of biscuits that kept me going. You’ve been the real MVPs. Without you, this thesis would have been nothing more than a faint idea sketched out in a delirious, caffeine-induced haze.

To my peers, the ones who pretended to be interested in my work and made small talk to keep me sane – thank you for the awkward silence and the shared look of desperation during group meetings. Your unspoken understanding was all I needed to feel like I wasn’t completely losing the plot.

Lastly, to my thesis itself: you’ve been a grueling, soul-sucking beast, but I’ve beaten you into submission. And honestly, you’re probably not even that good, but at least you’re done.
